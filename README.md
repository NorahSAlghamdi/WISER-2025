# WISER: 
The WISER (Work Internship, Student Experience in Research) Summer program is offered to TKS/High School students in Grades 10-12 and undergraduate university students (under 25) whose parents live at KAUST.

As an intern, you will gain hands-on experience with bioinformatics tools, analyzing sequencing data, retrieving and processing NCBI datasets with Biopython, and aligning biological sequences. You will also explore genome analysis and visualize COVID-19 proteins to study their structure and function, enhancing your understanding of computational biology.
